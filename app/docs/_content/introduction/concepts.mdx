# Core Concepts

This section introduces the key concepts you need to understand when working with Guardrails.

These concepts form the mental model of the system.



## Guardrail

A **guardrail** is a unit of logic that evaluates content or context and produces a structured result.

A guardrail:
- Has a name and stage
- Receives input and context
- Returns a decision (allow, warn, block, modify)
- Can attach metadata

Examples:
- Input size limits
- Prompt injection detection
- PII redaction
- Tool access control



## Guardrail stages

Guardrails run in specific stages:

- **Input** – before the model is invoked
- **Output** – after the model produces output
- **Tool** – when tools or actions are executed
- **General** – cross-cutting checks

Stages allow precise control over when enforcement happens.



## Profile

A **profile** is a collection of guardrails and configurations.

Profiles allow you to:
- Apply consistent policies
- Switch behavior by use case
- Manage complexity at scale

Profiles can be:
- Built-in
- Organization-specific
- User-specific
- Environment-specific



## Guardrail result

Each guardrail returns a structured result containing:

- Pass/fail status
- Action taken
- Severity level
- Optional message
- Optional metadata

Results are aggregated into a single execution response.



## Execution context

The **execution context** provides additional information to guardrails, such as:

- User identifiers
- API key identifiers
- Profile identifiers
- Validation type (input/output)
- Tool invocation data

This enables context-aware enforcement.



## Analytics event

An **analytics event** captures what happened during execution.

Events include:
- Guardrail execution events
- Profile usage events
- Rate-limit events

Events power:
- Dashboards
- Alerts
- Compliance reporting



## SDK client

The **SDK client** is the developer-facing interface for interacting with Guardrails.

It abstracts:
- API calls
- Authentication
- Error handling
- Retries and timeouts



## Putting it together

In practice:

1. A request is received
2. A profile is resolved
3. Guardrails are executed
4. Results are enforced
5. Analytics are recorded

This flow repeats consistently across all use cases.
