# Writing Custom Guardrails

Custom guardrails allow you to enforce **domain-specific rules** unique to your application.



## When to write a custom guardrail

- Industry-specific compliance
- Proprietary business logic
- Internal safety rules
- Organization-specific policies



## Guardrail structure

A guardrail consists of:

- A unique name
- An execution phase (input, output, tool)
- A configuration schema
- A deterministic `execute` function



## Example use cases

- Prevent medical advice without disclaimers
- Enforce region-specific data rules
- Restrict model usage by user role
- Enforce cost or latency limits



## Design principles

### Deterministic
Same input → same result.

### Fast
Guardrails should be lightweight.

### Observable
Emit analytics and logs.

### Configurable
Avoid hardcoded values.



## Testing custom guardrails

Every guardrail should have:

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Edge-case coverage



## Deployment

Once registered, custom guardrails:

- Can be added to profiles
- Appear in analytics
- Are enforced consistently



## Next steps

- Explore **Profiles**
- Learn about **Analytics**
- Review **SDK usage**
```
