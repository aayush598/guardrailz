# Output Guardrails

Output guardrails run **after the model generates a response**.

They ensure that generated content is safe, compliant, and aligned with policy.



## What output guardrails protect against

- PII or PHI leakage
- Hallucinated facts
- Unsafe instructions
- Confidential data exposure
- Policy-violating content
- Unstructured or invalid output



## Common output guardrails

- **PII Redaction**  
  Removes sensitive personal data.

- **Schema Validation**  
  Ensures output matches a required format.

- **Citation Requirement**  
  Requires sources for factual claims.

- **Confidentiality Enforcement**  
  Prevents internal data exposure.



## Enforcement actions

Output guardrails can:

- Block responses
- Modify content (redact, sanitize)
- Attach warnings
- Downgrade confidence
- Emit audit events



## Example flow

1. Model generates output
2. Output guardrails execute
3. Violations are detected
4. Output is redacted or blocked
5. Final response is returned



## Best practices

- Use **PII redaction** by default
- Require schemas for agent outputs
- Enforce citations in regulated domains
