# Environment Setup

This document explains how to configure Guardrails across different environments, from local development to production.



## Supported environments

Guardrails is designed to run consistently across:

- Local development
- Staging / preview environments
- Production systems
- Serverless platforms
- Containerized infrastructure



## Required environment variables

At minimum, the following environment variables must be configured:

```bash
GUARDRAILS_API_KEY=gr_live_xxxxxxxxx
GUARDRAILS_BASE_URL=https://api.guardrails.dev
````

### Optional variables

```bash
GUARDRAILS_TIMEOUT_MS=10000
GUARDRAILS_RETRIES=0
GUARDRAILS_LOG_LEVEL=info
```



## Environment separation

Always use **separate API keys per environment**:

| Environment | Key prefix  |
| -- | -- |
| Development | `gr_dev_`   |
| Staging     | `gr_stage_` |
| Production  | `gr_live_`  |

This ensures:

* Isolation of analytics
* Safer experimentation
* Clear audit trails



## Local development

For local development:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Never commit `.env.local` to source control.



## CI/CD usage

In CI pipelines:

* Store secrets in the CI secret manager
* Inject variables at runtime
* Never hardcode keys in config files

Example (GitHub Actions):

```yaml
env:
  GUARDRAILS_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GUARDRAILS_API_KEY }}
```



## Validation

To verify your setup, run a simple validation request and ensure it returns a success response.
