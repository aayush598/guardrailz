# Security

Guardrails is built with security as a first-class concern, both in runtime enforcement and platform design.



## API key security

API keys grant access to validation, profiles, and analytics.

### Best practices

- Never expose API keys in client-side code
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use least-privilege keys
- Revoke unused keys immediately



## Transport security

All communication with Guardrails uses:

- HTTPS only
- TLS 1.2+
- Encrypted payloads in transit

Requests over plain HTTP are rejected.



## Data handling

Guardrails is designed to minimize sensitive data exposure:

- Input text is processed in memory
- Analytics payloads are structured and scoped
- Optional redaction guardrails can be enabled
- Retention policies are configurable



## Access control

Guardrails supports:

- Per-user isolation
- Per-API-key limits
- Profile-based enforcement
- Tool-level permissions



## Auditing and observability

Every execution can emit structured analytics events:

- Guardrail pass/fail
- Execution latency
- Profile usage
- Rate limit hits

These events enable:
- Compliance audits
- Security monitoring
- Incident investigation



## Compliance readiness

Guardrails is designed to support regulated environments such as:

- Healthcare (HIPAA)
- Finance
- Education
- Enterprise SaaS



## Recommended guardrails

For high-security deployments, enable:

- Secrets detection
- PII redaction
- Internal data leak prevention
- Prompt injection protection
- Tool access control

- Prepare for high traffic → **Scaling**
