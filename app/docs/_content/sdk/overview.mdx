# SDK Overview

The Guardrails SDK provides a **lightweight, production-ready client** for integrating Guardrails into any JavaScript or TypeScript application.

It enables developers to validate inputs and outputs against Guardrail profiles with minimal overhead, while preserving observability, security, and scalability.



## Why use the SDK?

The SDK is designed for teams that want:

- Fast client-side or server-side validation
- Secure enforcement of guardrails
- Simple integration with existing apps
- Automatic analytics and telemetry
- Compatibility with profiles and policies



## What the SDK does

At a high level, the SDK:

1. Sends content to the Guardrails API
2. Applies the selected profile
3. Returns structured validation results
4. Optionally blocks, warns, or modifies content

The SDK does **not** embed guardrails locally.  
All enforcement happens on the Guardrails platform.



## Supported environments

The SDK works in:

- Node.js (backend services, agents)
- Server-side Next.js
- Edge-compatible runtimes (with fetch support)
- Browser environments (limited, validation-only)



## Core concepts

| Concept | Description |
|||
| Client | Configured instance of the SDK |
| Profile | Named collection of guardrails |
| Validation | Input or output enforcement |
| Result | Structured pass/fail response |
