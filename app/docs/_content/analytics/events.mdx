# Analytics Events

Analytics events are the **atomic unit** of observability in Guardrails.

Every meaningful runtime action emits a structured event that can be stored, queried, and analyzed.



## Event model

All analytics events share a common envelope:

- `eventId` – unique identifier
- `eventType` – event classification
- `timestamp` – time of occurrence
- `userId` – owning user
- `apiKeyId` – API key (if applicable)
- `profileId` – guardrail profile used
- `payload` – event-specific data

This model ensures consistency across event types.



## Core event types

### Guardrail executed

Emitted whenever guardrails are evaluated.

Includes:

- Overall pass/fail result
- Execution time (milliseconds)
- Individual guardrail outcomes
- Failure reasons (if any)

This is the most common and important event type.



### Profile used

Emitted when a guardrail profile is resolved and applied.

Useful for:

- Tracking profile adoption
- Auditing configuration usage
- Comparing profile effectiveness



### Rate limit hit

Emitted when a rate limit threshold is exceeded.

Includes:

- Limit type (minute / day)
- Threshold
- Current usage

Used for abuse detection and capacity planning.



## Event immutability

Analytics events are **append-only** and **immutable**.

This guarantees:

- Accurate historical reporting
- Reliable audits
- Tamper-resistant logs



## Event extensibility

New event types can be added without breaking existing analytics.

This allows Guardrails to evolve as new safety and compliance needs emerge.
