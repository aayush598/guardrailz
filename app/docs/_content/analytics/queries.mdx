# Analytics Queries

Analytics queries transform raw events into **actionable insights**.

They aggregate, filter, and compute metrics across time, profiles, and guardrails.



## Query philosophy

Guardrails analytics follows three principles:

1. Queries are read-only
2. Queries are deterministic
3. Queries never affect runtime execution

This ensures analytics is safe and reliable in production systems.



## Common query dimensions

Analytics queries typically group or filter by:

- Time range (last 24h, 7d, 30d)
- Profile
- Guardrail name
- API key
- Pass / fail outcome

These dimensions allow flexible analysis.



## Example insights

Using analytics queries, you can answer questions like:

- How many guardrail executions occurred today?
- Which guardrails fail most frequently?
- What is the average execution latency?
- Which profiles have the highest failure rates?
- Are failures increasing over time?



## Guardrail performance queries

Guardrail-level queries compute:

- Execution count per guardrail
- Failure rate
- Average execution time

These metrics help identify:

- Ineffective guardrails
- Performance bottlenecks
- Overly aggressive rules



## Time-series queries

Time-based queries enable:

- Trend analysis
- Spike detection
- Regression monitoring

They are commonly used for dashboards and alerts.
