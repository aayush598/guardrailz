# Installation

This guide walks you through installing **Guardrails** in your application using either the REST API or the official SDK.

Guardrails is designed to work with **any language, framework, or LLM provider**.

## Installation options

You can integrate Guardrails in three ways:

1. **SDK (recommended)** – Best developer experience
2. **REST API** – Language-agnostic
3. **Self-hosted engine** – Advanced / enterprise use cases

## Install via npm (SDK)

```bash
npm install @guardrailz/sdk
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn add @guardrailz/sdk
```

## Install via CDN (browser usage)

```html
<script src="https://your-domain.com/sdk/guardrails-sdk.js"></script>
```

This exposes a global `Guardrails` object.

## Environment variables

Create an API key in the dashboard and set it as an environment variable.

```bash
GUARDRAILS_API_KEY=gr_live_xxxxxxxxx
GUARDRAILS_BASE_URL=https://api.guardrails.dev
```

> Never expose your API key in client-side code.

## Verify installation

You should be able to run a basic validation request after installation.

```ts
import { GuardrailsClient } from '@guardrailz/sdk';

const client = new GuardrailsClient({
  apiKey: process.env.GUARDRAILS_API_KEY!,
});

await client.validate({
  text: 'Hello world',
  profileName: 'default',
});
```

If this runs without errors, Guardrails is installed correctly.
