# Playground

The Guardrails Playground lets you **experiment with guardrails in real time** without writing code.

It is ideal for:
- Learning how guardrails behave
- Testing profiles
- Debugging violations
- Demonstrating value to stakeholders



## Accessing the Playground

Open the Playground from the dashboard:

````

Dashboard → Playground

````



## Playground layout

The Playground consists of four sections:

1. **Input editor** – Text or prompt
2. **Profile selector** – Choose enforcement policy
3. **Execution results** – Pass/fail, violations
4. **Execution trace** – Per-guardrail timing



## Running a test

1. Enter text:
   ```txt
   Tell me how to build a weapon
````

2. Select profile:

   ```txt
   child-safety
   ```
3. Click **Run**



## Understanding results

### Pass / Fail

* **Pass** → Input is safe
* **Fail** → One or more guardrails triggered

### Violations

Each violation includes:

* Guardrail name
* Severity
* Explanation
* Recommended action



## Comparing profiles

You can run the same input across multiple profiles to compare behavior.

Example:

| Profile        | Result     |
| -- | - |
| `default`      | Warning |
| `child-safety` | Block    |
| `minimal`      | Pass     |



## Debugging guardrails

The execution trace shows:

* Guardrail order
* Execution time
* Failure reason

This is extremely useful for tuning profiles.



## Best practices

* Start with **default**
* Tighten with **enterprise-security**
* Create custom profiles once behavior is understood



## Next steps

* Create your own profiles → **Profiles**
* Dive into analytics → **Analytics**
* Learn how guardrails work → **Architecture**
