# Profiles Overview

Profiles define **how guardrails are composed, configured, and executed together**.

A profile represents a **policy bundle** that controls:

- Which guardrails run
- In what phase (input, output, tool, operational)
- With what configuration
- For which use case

Profiles are the **primary abstraction** used by Guardrails to apply safety, security, and compliance rules consistently across requests.



## Why profiles exist

Without profiles, guardrails would need to be:

- Manually enabled per request
- Reconfigured repeatedly
- Hard to reason about at scale

Profiles solve this by providing:

- **Reusable configurations**
- **Centralized policy management**
- **Clear separation of concerns**
- **Production-ready defaults**



## What a profile contains

At a high level, a profile includes:

- Metadata (name, description)
- Input guardrails
- Output guardrails
- Tool guardrails
- Optional operational guardrails

Each guardrail is defined declaratively with optional configuration.



## When profiles are applied

Profiles are resolved and compiled:

- At request time
- Based on `profileName` or `profileId`
- Before guardrail execution begins

The compiled profile is then executed by the Guardrails engine.



## Profile lifecycle

1. Profile is defined (built-in or custom)
2. Profile is selected at runtime
3. Profile is compiled into executable guardrails
4. Guardrails are executed
5. Analytics are recorded
