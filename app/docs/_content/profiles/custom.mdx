# Custom Profiles

Custom profiles allow you to define **your own guardrail policies** tailored to your application.

They are ideal when built-in profiles are not sufficient for your needs.



## What can be customized

With custom profiles, you can:

- Choose exactly which guardrails run
- Configure each guardrail independently
- Combine input, output, and tool guardrails
- Evolve policies without code changes



## Creating a custom profile

Profiles can be created via:

- Dashboard UI
- API
- SDK (programmatic)

A profile definition typically includes:

- Name and description
- Guardrails grouped by execution phase
- Optional configuration per guardrail



## Example (conceptual)

```json
{
  "name": "my-secure-profile",
  "inputGuardrails": [
    { "name": "InputSize", "config": { "maxChars": 30000 } },
    { "name": "SecretsInInput", "config": { "severity": "critical" } }
  ],
  "outputGuardrails": [
    { "name": "OutputPIIRedaction" }
  ]
}
````



## Versioning and evolution

Custom profiles can be:

* Updated over time
* Duplicated
* Archived

Guardrails ensures:

* Backward compatibility
* Safe rollout of changes
* Analytics visibility per profile



## Runtime selection

Profiles are selected at runtime using:

* `profileName`
* `profileId`

This allows dynamic policy enforcement per request or API key.
